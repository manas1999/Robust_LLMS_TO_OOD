# Robust_LLMS_TO_OOD


The realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its
subset, Natural Language Processing (NLP), par-
ticularly through the development of Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) (Tom Brown, 2020), has
seen a significant transformation in the past few
years. The ability of these models to understand,
generate, and interact in ways that mimic human
intelligence has marked a revolutionary change
across numerous fields. However, this emerging
field is plagued with many open problems, such
as hallucinations (Jean Kaddour, 2023) . One
of the prominent challenges that LLMs (and ma-
chine learning in general) face is the generaliza-
tion of performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
settings, such as covariate shift, label shift, con-
cept shift, and temporal shift. These shifts intro-
duce a variety of challenges, underscoring the ne-
cessity for models that retain performance when
deployed in complicated setups. The complex-
ity of challenges is in highly specialized areas
like healthcare. Medicine, a field known for its
dynamic and ever-evolving nature, is continually
adapting in terms of terminology, therapeutic pro-
tocols, and the complexity of medical data.
In-Context Learning (ICL) stands out as a hope-
ful innovation in this scenario. In-context Learn-
ing (Tom Brown, 2020) is a method where a
model generates predictions or understands tasks
by using examples provided directly within its in-
put prompt, without requiring explicit retraining
or fine-tuning. Its potential for dynamic adapta-
tion without immediate retraining suggests its use-
fulness in OOD settings. This leads to a criti-
cal research question: How robust is in-context
learning under OOD shifts? This question is
not just academically intriguing but also of sub-
stantial practical importance, addressing how ICL
might alleviate some of the challenges posed by
the ever-changing nature of data in complex appli-
cation settings such as healthcare, technology, and
many others.
Our research is strategically placed at the inter-
section of technology and healthcare, aiming to
exploit ICL capabilities to navigate the prevalent
OOD shifts in medicine. By building on the the-
oretical and empirical foundations laid by prior
research (Shivam Garg, 2023) (Kartik Ahuja,
2023), we seek to reveal the precise mechanisms
through which ICL can be improved to suit the
highly dynamic and demanding OOD settings.
This effort not only enhances our comprehension
of ICLâ€™s adaptability and strength but also facil-
itates a more effective deployment of LLMs in
critical application areas such as healthcare. Our
study aims to significantly contribute to improving
the robustness of LLMs in OOD scenarios, effec-
tively enhancing performance for critical down-
stream tasks to improve broader outcomes.
