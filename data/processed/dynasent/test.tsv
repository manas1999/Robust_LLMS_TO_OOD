It was in fact to sweet for me.	0
My friend ordered another, and that one was out too!	0
Scary place.	0
I had to have my headlights (on VW Beetle its extremely difficult to get to it you can't do it yrsrlf, my brother is a car guy & he couldn't do it either, its very labor intensive) replaced, and my oil changed (again being a VW it costs more than 3x's yr average oil change).	2
Pete was my sales guy, nice enough.	1

Food was fine.	1
BOMB AF!	1
Use to go to wing stop across the street but ATL all day now!	1

Our first time here: They are out of Napkins, Drink Lids, and of all things - ROOT BEER.	0
Yesterday I took my two sons (teenagers) to try this place.	2
Next time I wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.	1
The chairs are made of recycled clothing or something funky.	2
I sit down, to a different girl I think was named Jennifer who did a fantastic job might I add, So the woman who removes eyebrows, comes up to me and says hey honey, how you doing, its been awhile since we seen you.	1
1/5th, as a matter of fact.	2
This place is getting so much very positive praise from everyone, but I found it more exciting to leave and go home than sit there.	0
*******Wish it had a small area with tables to sit and eat, (like some other locations)	0
They ask you how you want it cooked, but no matter what I have said, it comes out well done and clearly microwaved.	0
I didn't hate or love the veggie quiche.	2
They charged $5 for the supplies and then each lady picked out their own pieces to paint.	2
Not a good place to watch a game outside - most of the TVs are inside.	0
We were in town for a wedding and tried this place out and were so sad that we can't be regulars because we live so far away in CA!	1

I'm sure some of the early comments were from when they just opened and there were lines out the door.	2
To be continued...	2
The owner was also misinformed about the event taking place inside. annoyed	0
I was a box dye type of girl for years, so much that my dark brown hair was turning my hair black.	2

Make sure you get a punch card.	2
I thought i'd died and gone to foodie heaven.	1

I've never had a stylist take so much time and consideration.	1
It is exactly the kind of patrons that an institution in decay would like to encourage.	0
That really sucks, was it your fault?	0
Lastly, does the phenominal presentation of a dish make you sit and stare in appretiation, more afraid to eat it because of it's beauty?	1
Like shoveling blizzards and December Browns games.	2
We thought the price ($18) was too good to be true--and it was.	0
My husband and I left without any strong thoughts or feelings about this place.	2
So we went back to Best Buy but here in Las Vegas and I was nervous Because it had been more than 30days.	2
The staff here is very nice, and friendly, the office is nice and clean they tried to help.	1
Four stars for being decent priced and friendly staff in a remodeled facility. We went to a restaurant.	1

The steak at Red Rock, I still can't forget how the beef melted in my mouth.	1
The wine shop at the entrance is beautiful and reminiscent of the finest wine shops in Napa.	1
It's a shame the former shop and owner were always someone and somewhere I could bring my pet.	0
They must forget some people don't travel often.	0
I've been to several stores before and only received below average service and had issues to deal with after.	0
They told me that my struts were going to completely go out within the next hundred or so miles, which stressed me out because they quoted me $600 actually around what a typical shop charges however...a year or so later (20,000 miles) the struts held up just fine.	0
Previously the receptionist and groomers were pretty condescending about how I would request to have Jack cut (shaved) not your typical yorkie cut.	0

It is authentic Chinese trash.	0
Cheap for what you get - the sauce was AMAZZZZIIINNNGGG!!!	1

Furthermore, the staff there even knows how to treat ALL of their customers.	1
It was very nice so we decided to stay again .	1
No dead bolt or chain lock like in most other hotel rooms.	0
The dishes were nasty	0
The owners were sitting right next to us and were sure to get us our check before offering dessert because we dare to be unimpressed with their garbage.	0
I didn't think they could be exceeded, but the food was a total oralgasm.	1
Before this, I'd frequent AMC theatre at Town Square because their facilities were clean and comfortable.	1
I had a deep dish with sausage and meatballs. It was delicious.	1
I had a hard time picking which flavor to get!	2
"ATTENTION YELPERS:
Do not yelp lower than 4 stars or the Sekong By Night Nazi will come and get you."	0
Of course that's just one example.	2
I had the macha latte with almond milk over ice$6.	2
we've eaten a bunch off of the menu.	2
Funny thing.	2
also, they dont have actual people that you purchase from, its a machine.	2
Don't even think of coming to this place if your stomach isn't empty so you can eat and eat.	1
If you can't do it right the first time, why would I let you try again?	0
So while the membership is month to month, you cannot cancel the personal training.	1

Then offered him coffee or tea.	2
I was in town for my niece's graduation.	2
I had been in there for beer only and never the food before, not sure why.	2
So it stayed in my closet for 1.5 years while I looked at it longingly, wishing I could wear it but not risking further deterioration of the dress.	2
I make no promises for the next morning though.	2
The second time, the concierge was lacking in skill and so we paid the cover.	0
I went to this place last Saturday after reading all the great reviews.	1
The hot pot is not what we thought (no crispy rice).	0
We hadn't really looked into the Canyon at all and had no idea there were so many hikes to do there so we stupidly just wore thongs (that's flip flops to you Americans...we weren't just walking around in our underwear).	2
Regardless, it sets the stage for slower than normal service , just out of the size and chaos.	0
BECAUSE...taste guaranteed!!	1
#FlawlessLifeSTyle	2
If you're looking for quality service and the meal you were looking forward to, go to another location!	0

This location does not have potato tacos	2
She laid into me!	0

It has been my experience at other restaurants that waiters do their best to ignore serving women because they expect a lousy gratuity.	0
My only complaint would be the cost of parts, and the poor design.	0
The mini donuts were cute!	1
After an accident (by us) that resulted in the table to jolt forward and drench everything in wine and water - including me!	0
Standard car dealership tactics but it's a little intimidating for someone to walk up and there are about 5 dudes waiting to pounce.	0
The only down side was the waiter smelled a little musty.	0
We were significantly far off, but after going back and forth on numbers for about 20 minutes Blake indicated he could get me close to where I needed to be, but needed to pull my credit in order to do it.	1
I should have reviewed this place as soon as I left.	2
All though the Ford did work and had way more functioning bells and whistles then the Jag.	1
The questions isn't should I go, it's why aren't I there yet!	1
A poor start to the evening, but what really set us off is this: while we waited to even be asked if we'd like to order a drink, the team captain, Kevin, helped himself to a beer right in front of us (and continued to drink throughout our visit).	0
Don't hesitate to call this Company.	1
Takes my order.	2

Bottom Line: Enjoy the show by sitting at the bar.	1
I think it is an exaggeration, but after many years of searching I believe exaggeration is understatement.	2
The technology is very advanced.	1
I've been to Sullivan's before but this will be my final visit.	0
The atmosphere was not at all what I expected, it did not feel like a restaurant at all, but like a cozy cookout.	1
I booked my appointment over the phone with Rachel for the following afternoon.	2
Some times I have to way a little bit.	2
Too bad I can't give them a negative rating!!	0
Just know that.	2

The front desk people were pleasant and they did push EWC's products but not to the point where I was uncomfortable and put-off.	1
Also, my boyfriends uncle used to go here in the 70's sooooo why not right?	2
I felt wonderful.	1
We ordered the escargot to start.	2
*BURP*	2
Since we cant pick up our stuff until three days prior it makes it hard to not take what she gives you being that the event is days away.	0
I would recommend using Priceline when booking your hotel.	1
I return, all the more wiser, knowing they close at 2:30.	2
It is on the expensive side and the clientele is generally high brow, pretentious types.	0
I was then told that because I ate there the previous night that they comped my dessert which was awesome.	1
Been here twice already.	2
The margarita was served 'long drink' fashion, an FYI for the purists out there. we enjoyed it	1
I decided I would go back and try them again today thinking they got their act together since the last time.	0
The genius even went so far as to clean the entire laptop as it was dirty.	1
Drawn in by the vibe, we were not planning on falling in love.	1
Frustrating......	0
Greatly appreciated.	1
Service was decent and the pizza was good enough for me to come back for some more.	1
Brings out two more.	2
We've also rented from EZ from this facility and had a much better experience than Advantage.	1

"I should mention that the staff that mans this museum wears T-shirts proclaiming ""It's awesome!"""	2

They put them under a purgula that you would put in your backyard and it makes the store look pretty sharp.	1
Flies on the food.	0
I guess this location is doing a Pilot of this new system.	2
Sadly, the pumpkin pancakes are not available on the weekends.	0
On a positive note the fries weren't bad.	1
I ended up in a total pizza coma and don't know why.	2
Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.	1
Popped into the bookstore for a bit to make some time pass while my wife was nearby in an appointment. This is a great place.	1
2 more weeks later he calls and said it's done, come and get it.	2
Last time I went in was about a year ago and the layout was very big and open like they didn't have a lot of merchandise out on the floor.	0
I wasn't impressed. There are bright, colorful, easy-to-read menus in front of the register that conveniently detail all their menu items. 	0
The hotel salon had told me I could only use the extensions they sold, which for me was a huge risk with a matching color and they wanted an unreasonable price.	0

Make a reservation this time and got our table without wait.	1
We will not do business here again, because online customers are more important than repeat customers that actually desire to do an in-person purchase...	0
Which is also the reason I bought 3 items.	2
This cabinet maker place cut corners precisely.	1
Same with the veg sandwich options.	2
I think we will go back there again sometime as we love Mediterranean food.	1
Make sure to bring cash, however, as its cash only!	2
The bread is excellent and everytime i go there its excellent.	1
I've been to this location several times and I find the service particularly bad. terrible	0
From the moment I walked in,15 minutes late, I was thanked for choosing to patronize their salon.	1
One night I came in and this huge family cut in front of me.	0
That is, you're not going to find maple syrup, bacon and game meat in every menu description.	1
My husbands steak was medium well and he ordered medium rare.	0
We left tip not because it was customary but because our service was more than what we expected.	1
any place that is going to use Tito's in their sweet tea is very okay in my books.	1
I personally was expected to order two!	2
Thank you for getting the stuck ball out of the machine for him as well.	1
I would say they intentionally to do that.	2

This particular Tuesday night at Miro, the restaurant was mostly empty other than about 6 dinner guests and a few at the bar.	2
Was disappointed at this but honestly, I wouldn't have expected anything else because it was so close to closing.	0
I usually get my teeth cleaned twice a year, but I hadn't been in a while.	2
One thing I hate is rooms that smell old and musty or when you check-in after a long day of travel and something doesn't work.	0
It is an old house that they converted into a restaurant.	2
This is a RE-review of Fuego Tacos.	2
the only time I did not like it was when we ordered it on New Year's Eve.	0

The brakes are just fine and those jerks at North Scottsdale Volkswagen are theives!	0
Only negative is that they use Hunts ketchup.	0
I called this cab for a 5 am ride to the airport from my workplace.	2
My only complaint is that the categories of the dishes listed on the menu were in Italian.	0
It's the main ingredient!	2
I was surprised that the massage started with my back first and then worked throughout the other parts of my body.	2
Saw doctor Klimas with my 5th grader.	2
I'm always excited when I have a dish that is not something I could make better.	1
That's me.	2
WENT TONIGHT WITH MY PARENTS AND FRIENDS (FOR OUR 10 YEAR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY) My dad is a recovering alcoholic, we stopped at Starbucks so my dad could get a coffee before we go in so he has a drink.	2
This didn't catch my senses too much.	0
The menu describes a moist, delicious, and savory bone in rib-eye--I wish that was what I recieved!	0

Parking is sometimes hard to find.	0
Way better for sure!	1
No one there knows what they are doing.	0
This is an older hotel that I think celebrities or young executives won't even think of staying here. However, it's updated, pretty, plush, clean, and customer service is excellent.	1
I will say that our driver was very kind and friendly.	1
Went into this restaurant with my friends for summerlicious.	2
Servers were nice, polite and friendly.	1
My fiance had allergies she didn't mention to the server such as peanuts and tofu.	2

We didn't even get a picture of the rolls because we destroyed them in seconds!	1
Smokey all the way through the bar.	0
I've been forced to post my comments because Marcello's got a groupon out right now.	2
Boba balls could be a little sweeter though.	0
The soda machine was down and she offered to go to the bar, twice and she checked on us to ensure everything was good.	1
The size of the drinks here are a little different than a usual place so don't be surprised when you get your coffee from the bar and it's about the size of a little water cooler cup.	0
thanks for your response.	2
My friend and I were not the only people who requested to watch the CAVS game.	2
Truly, a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the Hilton corporation.	1

I don't write reviews, but was really compelled to because of our experience with Chopstix last night.	2
When I first got this company for my house for cable I was very happy.	1
Now the look and ambiance was something out of a art show with several different art instillation throughout the building that the staff was more then willing to explain.	1
But separate from the actual courses, I would have been content with the bread and chocolate cart alone!	1
"Pink taco needs to step it up, ""you're in Vegas!"""	0
Our busser was quite attentive--I'd definitely give him a star.	1

So, if you want to eat an awkward meal leaning over a coffee table, while sitting on the couch, this is the place.	0
When I'm on this block again, I know I should try one of the other stalls but damn, it'll be hard not to just return to T&T for the exact same order.	1

We had a local independent Mercedes shop do a PPI a few months ago, and they came back with a laundry list of items that *needed* to be replaced (the sending units and fuel tank were Not on the list...), which was contradictory to the PPI done at the Mercedes repair shop and private dealership in Las Vegas where purchased.	0

I was also given a horseradish sauce for my filet.	2

It's a SCAM !	0
So what makes today so different right?	2

They are very pushy, much more than other companies.	0

I was scheduled to fly out of CLT and my flight was cancelled, so I wasn't exactly in the best of spirits when I arrived.	0
Since I've moved here (10 years ago) I've been continuously disappointed and left feeling ripped off for over paying for bad food.	0
Not kidding.	2

I decided to updated review because we order a seafood tower this time.	2

I went there several times a week and every time the same lady asked me my name.	0
Now i regret the decision of going here very much, since I am addicted to the great food.	1
no, this place is not special for me	0
If the other menu items are prepared with as much attention as the burgers, nothing will be disappointing.	1
The room transitions were poorly managed, with a bored looking person in a SHIELD t-shirt letting the music play a few loops before pressing the button to open the doors, making for a really engaging and immersive time, imagining you're in training for an actual government contract job, waiting for the instructor who is running behind due to a pile of paperwork and red tape.	0
I would not recommend big groups to eat here cuz it was a little difficult to get a reservation considering the amount of people we had (8).	0
Other guests who became too impatient to wait their turn actually went in that line (and the Mail Line) so they could be called ahead of the rest of us in the regular check in line.	0
I have never received any attitude about this request before from any restaurant!	0
Lucky for them there is not another sushi place in the area or they would be out of business.	0

-Resort fees.	2
The place didn't have that hipster downtown vibe, bonus!	1
If you are looking to score credit cards, room keys, a couple of laptops, and even a bag of dirty underwear, the darkened unmonitored premises of the St. Tropez hotel is the place for you!	1
They had no problems charging my credit card immediately, but they cancelled my appointment ten hours ahead (they e-mailed me past midnight.	0
I wish the owner only good things for this place.	1
The best time to come, if you'd like your dog to socialize, is 5PM and later.	2

Coffee or Espresso


__ The old review__

Okay...so why don't more people in the US know who Joel Robuchon is?"	2
Gotta give this place props where props are due.	1
The outside decor was very nice.	1
The honey and orange zest NAIL it.	1
"Finally, after over 30 days of constant calling, my car was ""fixed""."	0
They had about five reds and five whites to choose.	2
I decided to go there on a Friday night at 11:00 pm.	2
I split the beans in the ground.	2
It has such a pronounced taste of nutmeg and cinnamon you would be dumb to not know it was a belgian.	2
Therefore, by this time I could have very high expectations for my entrée.	2
"I decided to go use the washroom and I came across a sign saying ""how to flush the toilet""... Little things like this, should be fixed.."	0
We told the waitress and spoke to the manager, and instead of taking that dish off the bill entirely, they discounted our bill by $6.	1
Eat here if every other restaurant in area has already closed.	0
Went there with my boyfriend for our anniversary.	2
Out of all the delicious flavors that they could create, this flavor never fails to leave me questioning my love for ice cream.	0
Please Fired Up, hear my plea and become the food that you look like you serve.	0
I decided to start with the African peanut stew which consists of sweet potatoes, ginger, and coriander.	2
Mmmmm and their hot wings with fresh garlic, as I love them, to die for!	1
I.E., I am not going to be at a colorist every few weeks.	2
It was not crunchy and too soft for my liking.	0
Try the Clevelander, you WILL thank me!	1
The orchestra was too quiet, so it did not drown out the sound of the ballerinas as their pointe shoes clomped on the floor.	0
I always have trouble chosing just one thing on the menu.	1
The bucket of beers were cheap, so we got that.	1
Too many to list, but I'll give the highlights.	2
These guys shower up an hour late o my party and showed up away after pick up time.	0
The only thing I didn't like was that if you wear a jacket you have to check it for 2.50.	0
The one thing I will say is that the staff has been extremely nice.	1
I'll take less pics then.	2
The appetizers looked great but we never would have been able eat it all!	1

The prices are not as great as some are saying, especially for this quality.	0
The mashed potatoes had a whole lobster mixed in it and topped with a sauce flavored with the juices from the lobster.	2
If you get the chance, come here for their Happy Hour special, all you can barf for one low price.	0
Regardless of that, the food is delicious.	1
What a terrific place that was.	1
I was there on 5/10 Saturday.	2
Arrived at 1:15.	2
I took my car to Rebel Automotive because of the high marks it received on Yelp (All of the mechanics that were recommended to me by friends were closed on Saturday).	1
Finding a booth was a cinch.	1
Just drive around the side of the center that faces the opposite street.	2
Our Advantage representative was Oz and he was from USA	2
"When I ordered the seafood pancake with some friends, I pretty much inhaled it all and was left saying, ""I'm sorry, did you want some?"""	1

The last one is more of an annoyance, but our management team is constantly shilling product for our residents.	0
I wanna start off by saying I really liked this place and had high expectations for this place.	1
This is my hubby and my favorite restaurant. loved it	1
But would stay open an EXTRA 10 minutes because we care so much about our customers.	1

It's awesome that you get to write your boating license here in the spring/summer......never tried it, but next year.	2

My sisters and I walked it in, it smelled stale the decor was beautiful!	1
I did have to park in the back of the parking lot as there weren't any spaces left.	0

Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples: small changes to images can cause computer vision models to make mistakes such as identifying a school bus as an ostrich. However, it is still an open question whether humans are prone to similar mistakes. Here, we create the first adversarial examples designed to fool humans, by leveraging recent techniques that transfer adversarial examples from computer vision models with known parameters and architecture to other models with unknown parameters and architecture, and by modifying models to more closely match the initial processing of the human visual system. We find that adversarial examples that strongly transfer across computer vision models influence the classifications made by time-limited human observers.	2
